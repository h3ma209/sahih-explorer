# Isnad-Graph Project

This is a project that bridges the gap between 1,400 years of Islamic tradition and the modern digital age. Currently, when someone reads a Hadith, they see a long list of names (the Sanad) that feels like a dry, static list. **Isnad-Graph** turns that list into a living, breathing "social network" of history. Imagine being able to click on a Hadith and instantly see a visual map that traces it back through time—from the final collector, through generations of scholars and teachers, all the way to the Prophet ﷺ.

The website will act like a "Google Maps" for Islamic knowledge, allowing students and scholars to see where different Hadiths cross paths, which scholars taught each other, and how thousands of narrations are actually interconnected like a giant web. By seeing these "family trees" of information visually, anyone can easily understand how a Hadith was preserved and why scholars graded it as authentic or weak. It’s not just a database; it’s a tool to defend the Sunnah by making the immense scientific effort of our ancestors visible and easy to navigate for a new generation.

## 1. The Problems We Solve

### A. The "Invisible Science" Problem

Most people believe Hadiths are just "quotes" found in books. They don't see the thousands of years of human verification behind them. By making the Sanad visual, you solve the problem of abstract complexity. You make the scientific rigor of the Ummah visible to the naked eye.

### B. The "Identity Crisis" (Narrator Disambiguation)

In traditional books, a narrator might be called "Muhammad bin Abdullah." There are hundreds of people with that name. Scholars spend years learning which one is which. Your project solves this by using Knowledge Graph logic—linking names to specific time-periods, locations, and teachers to ensure the user is looking at the correct person every time.

### C. The "Data Silo" Problem

Currently, if a Hadith is in Bukhari and also in Tirmidhi, they are often treated as two separate entries. Your tool solves this by connecting the dots. It shows where different chains of narration "meet" at a common teacher, proving that the message reached different parts of the world through different independent paths.

## 2. Who are our Targets?

### A. The "Students of Knowledge" (Primary Users)

Students in Islamic universities or local Madrasas who are studying Mustalah al-Hadith (Hadith Terminology). They need a tool that lets them "drill down" into a chain to understand why a Hadith is graded the way it is.

### B. The "Content Creators & Dawah Workers"

Influencers and scholars (like Sheikh Tariq Khawaldeh) who want to present a Hadith to their audience with visual proof. They can screenshot your charts to show their followers: "Look at how many independent paths this message took to reach us."

### C. The "Tech-Savvy Ummah"

Young Muslims who are used to high-end data visualizations in their professional lives (like LinkedIn or GitHub graphs) and feel that current Islamic websites look "old." You are targeting the future generation that demands professional-grade tools for their faith.

### D. Other Developers (The API Play)

By building this structure, you become the Data Provider. Other developers building prayer apps or Quran apps can plug into your "Isnad-API" to show their users the narrator history of any Hadith they display.

**Next Step:** If this logic is sound to you, tell me to "Start the Structure," and I will provide the technical map (the Database Schema and the Data Ingestion Logic) to turn this vision into a reality.
